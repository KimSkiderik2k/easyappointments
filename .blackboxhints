# Project: EasyAppointments – Blackbox autonomy test

CONTEXT
- This folder is a local copy/fork of the Easy!Appointments booking system.
- It is a sandbox for testing Blackbox AI autonomous coding. No real users, no secrets.
- You are allowed to refactor, reorganise files, and add tooling (e.g. Docker) as needed.

PRIMARY GOAL
- Turn this repository into a fully working appointment booking system on my Mac.

REQUIREMENTS
- I must be able to start EVERYTHING with ONE command from the project root, e.g.:
  - `docker compose up`
  - or a single script/command you define.
- Database schema must be created and migrations applied automatically.
- Seed test data and create a default admin login. Document credentials clearly.
- Update README.md with a clear "Local development with Blackbox" section:
  - prerequisites (Docker, PHP, Node, etc.)
  - exact run command(s)
  - how to log in as admin.
- Create AUTONOMY_REPORT.md:
  - what you changed,
  - important design decisions,
  - known limitations and TODOs.

CONSTRAINTS
- Do NOT add external paid SaaS or new third-party accounts.
- Do NOT hardcode real API keys or secrets. Use .env and .env.example with placeholders.
- Prefer using the technologies already in the project (PHP/MySQL/etc.) unless you have a very strong reason.

WORKING STYLE
- Work autonomously. Do NOT ask the user questions unless absolutely necessary to make progress.
- When in doubt, make a reasonable decision and document it in AUTONOMY_REPORT.md.
- Use git best practices:
  - small, coherent commits,
  - sensible commit messages,
  - do not force-push to main.
